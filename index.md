### Welcome! 

I am an evolutionary biologist and Postdoctoral Researcher in Genomics and Bioinformatics in [Leif Andersson’s lab](https://www.uu.se/en/news-media/researcher-profiles/leif-andersson/) at [Uppsala University](http://www.uu.se/en). My research is driven by my fascination with biodiversity and the evolutionary processes that generate diversity in wild populations. Projects I work on leverage current technologies in genomic sequencing and experimental behavioral study to describe the mechanisms that maintain population and trait diversity through natural, social, and sexual selection processes. These projects span a diverse range of organisms.

## Evolution of female ornamentation in the White-shouldered Fairywren

<img src="/assets/images/duet2.jpg" width="700">

The elaborate coloration of many male animals has inspired biologists to study the function of elaborate male ornaments since Darwin and Wallace. That male ornaments face sexual and social selection pressures is now fundamental in evolutionary biology, but what function, if any, female ornaments serve is comparatively less known. My Ph.D. dissertation focused on a unique species of bird that varies between subspecies by female, but not male, coloration. This provides a system well suited for studying the function and physiology of female coloration. I experimentally test the function of female ornaments using controlled song and mount playback trials to free flying birds and compare the role of testosterone in mediating aggression and ornamentation between the sexes.  

Ongoing work in this system is unraveling the evolutionary history of the various White-shouldered Fairywren subspecies, examining evidence for selection on female ornamentation using genomics, and understanding the proximate mechanisms shaping signal production. Much of this work was generously funded by an [NSF Dissertation Improvement Grant](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1701781&HistoricalAwards=false).

## Genomics of the Darwin’s Finch radiation

My postdoctoral research primarily focuses on the proximate mechanisms for how selection functions at the population and individual levels in the radiation of Thraupidae finches on the Galapágos Islands. The basis for this research has involved the generation and analysis of 4,000 Darwin's finch genomes derived from individually marked finches collected over 40 years on Daphne Major by Drs. Peter and Rosemary Grant. This project required the development of methods to use low-coverage (2x) data to estimate population allele frequencies from wild populations. Using this dataset, we can identify and track through time functional variants related to natural variation.

## Adaptation to diverse environments in marine organisms

<img src="/assets/images/rhodopsin3.png" width="700">

In many marine fish systems huge population sizes provide a powerful model for population genomics analysis aimed at understanding how populations adapt to different local environmental conditions. In one study, we described a recent selective sweep driven by a missense mutation in fish rhodopsin that facilitates adaptation to the red-shifted light environment in Baltic Sea herring and has occurred >20 times in other fish transitioning to freshwater environments. In contrast to the Atlantic Herring, the European eel exhibits an unusual life history where breeding occurs in the central Atlantic Ocean, but all adults spend their life in continental Europe in environments ranging from warm to cold and brackish to freshwater. Considerable disagreement in the literature has failed to demonstrate if continental eel populations represent a single panmictic population or consist of populations locally adapted to their environment. We use whole genome analysis from hundreds of individuals to solve this enigma and were able to compellingly demonstrate that the predominant mechanism that allow eels to inhabit diverse environments is plastic and not genetic.

## Hybrid rabbit genome assembly
<img src="/assets/images/hic2.png" width="700">

Hybridization between subspecies are a powerful natural tool to study the process of speciation and identify genetic regions associated with reproductive isolation. Two subspecies of the European rabbit (*Oryctolagus cuniculus*) hybridize on the Iberian Peninsula which seems to be maintained by postzygotic isolating mechanisms. We are leveraging the high nucleotide diversity in this species, with an average nucleotide diversity of 0.9%, to generate a fully phase genome assembly using a single hybrid individual. We will use the resulting genome assemblies to search for structural variants putatively responsible for maintaining reproductive isolation.

## Genomics of trait evolution in birds
<img src="/assets/images/yewa.png" width="700">

From supergenes in ruffs, to the rapid radiation of plumages in male wagtails and the diversity in beak shapes of Galapagos finches, I work on a variety of projects that utilize modern genome sequencing techniques to search for the molecular basis of trait evolution in birds. In Ruff, I have curated gene annotations for a new high-quality reference genome that we use to better understand the role of purifying selection on major genomic inversions. I examine dozens of populations of wagtails that have diversified widely in male plumage evolution, but show little to no genetic divergence, which provide a powerful opportunity for understanding the molecular signature of sexual selection. Lastly, I use samples collected over the course of forty years of monitoring by Peter and Rosemary Grant on how the Galapagos finches respond to environmental and social fluctuations to search for signatures of adaptation in thousands of sequenced finch genomes. 

## Engagement in conservation

My research has a strong tropical focus, which often takes place in regions where the local communities have close social and economic ties to the environment where they live. New Guinea is a particularly biodiverse location where more than 5% of the world's species are present on less than 1% of the world’s landmass. The relatively small populace and remoteness of the country has led to some of the most pristine wilderness in the world, but these are increasingly facing threats from anthropogenic pressure in population growth, climate change, and exploitation for fossil fuels and agriculture. We work closely with local communities where we work to advocate for and develop a locally led group dedicated to grassland conservation. The goal of this project is to support the idea that conservation is not just for the community, but by the community as well.
