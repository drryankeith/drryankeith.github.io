### Welcome! 

I am an evolutionary biologist and Postdoctoral Researcher in Genomics and Bioinformatics in [Leif Andersson’s lab](https://www.uu.se/en/news-media/researcher-profiles/leif-andersson/) at [Uppsala University](http://www.uu.se/en). My research is driven by my fascination with biodiversity and the evolutionary processes that generate diversity in wild populations. Projects I work on leverage current technologies in genomic sequencing and experimental behavioral study to describe the mechanisms that maintain population and trait diversity through natural, social, and sexual selection processes. These projects span a diverse range of organisms.

## Evolution of female ornamentation in the White-shouldered Fairywren

<img src="/assets/images/duet2.jpg" width="700">

The elaborate coloration of many male animals has inspired biologists to study the function of elaborate male ornaments since Darwin and Wallace. That male ornaments face sexual and social selection pressures is now fundamental in evolutionary biology, but what function, if any, female ornaments serve is comparatively less known. My Ph.D. dissertation focused on a unique species of bird that varies between subspecies by female, but not male, coloration. This provides a system well suited for studying the function and physiology of female coloration. I experimentally test the function of female ornaments using controlled song and mount playback trials to free flying birds and compare the role of testosterone in mediating aggression and ornamentation between the sexes.  

Ongoing work in this system is unraveling the evolutionary history of the various White-shouldered Fairywren subspecies, examining evidence for selection on female ornamentation using genomics, and understanding the proximate mechanisms shaping signal production. Much of this work was generously funded by an [NSF Dissertation Improvement Grant](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1701781&HistoricalAwards=false).

## Fish rhodopsin evolution

<img src="/assets/images/rhodopsin3.png" width="700">

Fish occupy a wide range of environments that vary in the local light environment. Within the past 10,000 years the Atlantic herring colonized the brackish Baltic Sea after its formation which was facilitated by adaptation to the red-shifted light environment of the Baltic. We study visual adaptation to this novel environment and characterize a single amino acid mutation in rhodopsin, an important photoreceptor in the retina, that was subject to a rapid selective sweep. In ongoing work, we explore how rhodopsin has been co-opted to facilitate adaptation to different light environments across fish species.

## Hybrid rabbit genome assembly
<img src="/assets/images/hic2.png" width="700">

Hybridization between subspecies are a powerful natural tool to study the process of speciation and identify genetic regions associated with reproductive isolation. Two subspecies of the European rabbit (*Oryctolagus cuniculus*) hybridize on the Iberian Peninsula which seems to be maintained by postzygotic isolating mechanisms. We are leveraging the high nucleotide diversity in this species, with an average nucleotide diversity of 0.9%, to generate a fully phase genome assembly using a single hybrid individual. We will use the resulting genome assemblies to search for structural variants putatively responsible for maintaining reproductive isolation.

## Genomics of trait evolution in birds
<img src="/assets/images/yewa.png" width="700">

From supergenes in ruffs, to the rapid radiation of plumages in male wagtails and the diversity in beak shapes of Galapagos finches, I work on a variety of projects that utilize modern genome sequencing techniques to search for the molecular basis of trait evolution in birds. In Ruff, I have curated gene annotations for a new high-quality reference genome that we use to better understand the role of purifying selection on major genomic inversions. I examine dozens of populations of wagtails that have diversified widely in male plumage evolution, but show little to no genetic divergence, which provide a powerful opportunity for understanding the molecular signature of sexual selection. Lastly, I use samples collected over the course of forty years of monitoring by Peter and Rosemary Grant on how the Galapagos finches respond to environmental and social fluctuations to search for signatures of adaptation in thousands of sequenced finch genomes. 

## Engagement in conservation

My research has a strong tropical focus, which often takes place in regions where the local communities have close social and economic ties to the environment where they live. New Guinea is a particularly biodiverse location where more than 5% of the world's species are present on less than 1% of the world’s landmass. The relatively small populace and remoteness of the country has led to some of the most pristine wilderness in the world, but these are increasingly facing threats from anthropogenic pressure in population growth, climate change, and exploitation for fossil fuels and agriculture. We work closely with local communities where we work to advocate for and develop a locally led group dedicated to grassland conservation. The goal of this project is to support the idea that conservation is not just for the community, but by the community as well.
