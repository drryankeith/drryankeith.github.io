I am a Ph.D. Candidate in [Dr. Jordan Karubian’s lab](karubianlab.tulane.edu) in the [Department of Ecology and Evolution](http://www2.tulane.edu/sse/eebio/) at [Tulane University](http://www.tulane.edu).

I am broadly interested in the processes that drive global biodiversity, with a particular interest in tropical ecosystems. My Ph.D. dissertation focuses on the mechanisms and adaptive benefits of plumage ornamentation in female White-shouldered Fairywrens (*Malurus alboscapulatus*) of New Guinea. In this unique system, several subspecies around the island of New Guinea vary only in degree of female ornamentation (or plumage with “bright characteristics”), while male plumage remains constant around the island. I leverage this pattern of variation to examine hypotheses relating to the evolution and maintenance of female traits. My research includes a strong international component and I spend much of my time working at field sites located in Milne Bay and Western Province, Papua New Guinea.
