<h1>Erik Enbody</h1>

<p>I am an evolutionary biologist and Postdoctoral Researcher in Genomics and Bioinformatics in <a class="dark-blue"
    href="https://www.uu.se/en/news-media/researcher-profiles/leif-andersson/">Leif Andersson’s lab</a> at <a
    class="dark-blue" href="http://www.uu.se/en">Uppsala University</a>. My research is driven by my fascination with
  biodiversity and the
  evolutionary processes that generate diversity in wild populations. Projects I work on leverage current technologies
  in genomic sequencing and experimental behavioral study to describe the mechanisms that maintain population and trait
  diversity through natural, social, and sexual selection processes. These projects span a diverse range of organisms.

  <h3>Evolution of female ornamentation in the
    White-shouldered Fairywren</h3>

  <p><img src="/assets/images/duet2.jpg" class="db ba w-100" /></p>

  <p>The elaborate coloration of many male animals has inspired biologists to study the function of elaborate male
    ornaments since Darwin and Wallace. That male ornaments face sexual and social selection pressures is now
    fundamental
    in evolutionary biology, but what function, if any, female ornaments serve is comparatively less known. My Ph.D.
    dissertation focused on a unique species of bird that varies between subspecies by female, but not male, coloration.
    This provides a system well suited for studying the function and physiology of female coloration. I experimentally
    test the function of female ornaments using controlled song and mount playback trials to free flying birds and
    compare
    the role of testosterone in mediating aggression and ornamentation between the sexes.</p>

  <p>Ongoing work in this system is unraveling the evolutionary history of the various White-shouldered Fairywren
    subspecies, examining evidence for selection on female ornamentation using genomics, and understanding the proximate
    mechanisms shaping signal production. Much of this work was generously funded by an <a class="dark-blue"

      Improvement Grant</a>.</p>

  <h3>Genomics of the Darwin’s Finch radiation</h3>

  <p><img src="/assets/images/freq_cactus_diet_fig_V2.png" class="db ba w-100" /></p>

  <p>My postdoctoral research primarily focuses on the proximate mechanisms for how selection functions at the
    population
    and individual levels in the radiation of Thraupidae finches on the Galapágos Islands. The basis for this research
    has
    involved the generation and analysis of 4,000 Darwin’s finch genomes derived from individually marked finches
    collected over 40 years on Daphne Major by Drs. Peter and Rosemary Grant. This project required the development of
    methods to use low-coverage (2x) data to estimate population allele frequencies from wild populations. Using this
    dataset, we can identify and track through time functional variants related to natural variation.</p>

</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/rhodopsin3.png" class="db ba w-100" /></p>

<p>In many marine fish systems huge population sizes provide a powerful model for population genomics analysis aimed at
  understanding how populations adapt to different local environmental conditions. In one study, we described a recent
  selective sweep driven by a missense mutation in fish rhodopsin that facilitates adaptation to the red-shifted light
  environment in Baltic Sea herring and has occurred &gt;20 times in other fish transitioning to freshwater
  environments. In contrast to the Atlantic Herring, the European eel exhibits an unusual life history where breeding
  occurs in the central Atlantic Ocean, but all adults spend their life in continental Europe in environments ranging
  from warm to cold and brackish to freshwater. Considerable disagreement in the literature has failed to demonstrate if
  continental eel populations represent a single panmictic population or consist of populations locally adapted to their
  environment. We use whole genome analysis from hundreds of individuals to solve this enigma and were able to
  compellingly demonstrate that the predominant mechanism that allow eels to inhabit diverse environments is plastic and
  not genetic.</p>

  <h3>Hybrid rabbit genome assembly</h3>
  <p><img src="/assets/images/hic2.png" class="db ba w-100" /></p>

  <p>Hybridization between subspecies are a powerful natural tool to study the process of speciation and identify
    genetic
    regions associated with reproductive isolation. Two subspecies of the European rabbit (<em>Oryctolagus
      cuniculus</em>)
    hybridize on the Iberian Peninsula which seems to be maintained by postzygotic isolating mechanisms. We are
    leveraging
    the high nucleotide diversity in this species, with an average nucleotide diversity of 0.9%, to generate a fully
    phase
    genome assembly using a single hybrid individual. We will use the resulting genome assemblies to search for
    structural
    variants putatively responsible for maintaining reproductive isolation.</p>

  <h3>Genomics of trait evolution in birds</h3>
  <p><img src="/assets/images/yewa.png" class="db ba w-100" /></p>

  <p>From supergenes in ruffs, to the rapid radiation of plumages in male wagtails and the diversity in beak shapes of
    Galapagos finches, I work on a variety of projects that utilize modern genome sequencing techniques to search for
    the
    molecular basis of trait evolution in birds. In Ruff, I have curated gene annotations for a new high-quality
    reference
    genome that we use to better understand the role of purifying selection on major genomic inversions. I examine
    dozens
    of populations of wagtails that have diversified widely in male plumage evolution, but show little to no genetic
    divergence, which provide a powerful opportunity for understanding the molecular signature of sexual selection.
    Lastly, I use samples collected over the course of forty years of monitoring by Peter and Rosemary Grant on how the
    Galapagos finches respond to environmental and social fluctuations to search for signatures of adaptation in
    thousands
    of sequenced finch genomes.</p>

  <p>My research has a strong tropical focus, which often takes place in regions where the local communities have close
    social and economic ties to the environment where they live. New Guinea is a particularly biodiverse location where
    more than 5% of the world’s species are present on less than 1% of the world’s landmass. The relatively small
    populace
    and remoteness of the country has led to some of the most pristine wilderness in the world, but these are
    increasingly
    facing threats from anthropogenic pressure in population growth, climate change, and exploitation for fossil fuels
    and
    agriculture. We work closely with local communities where we work to advocate for and develop a locally led group
    dedicated to grassland conservation. The goal of this project is to support the idea that conservation is not just
    for
    the community, but by the community as well. To read more about our conservation initiatives in PNG, follow <a
