<h1>Ryan J. Keith</h1>

<p> I am an impactful educator and social-ecological scientist with eight years' experience teaching at universities, schools, and zoos. 
  I am particularly fascinated by interactions between people and natural environments, with my research currently focusing on 
  how urban children connect with nature.

  Despite what this website's <a class="link blue underline-hover"
                                 href="http://drryankeith.com">URL</a> would have you believe, I'm not <i>quite</i> a doctor just yet. I am currently finishing up my PhD in the <a class="link blue underline-hover"

    class="link blue underline-hover" href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/home.html">The University of Sydney</a>, under the watchful eye of Prof <a

  <p>You may have heard that city kids are suffering from <a class="link blue underline-hover" href="http://richardlouv.com/blog/what-is-nature-deficit-disorder">nature-deficit disorder</a>
as a result of their high-tech modern lives. The idea that our youth are disconnected 
from nature has been accepted as conventional wisdom, leading to concerns about 
children's health, wellbeing, and appreciation of the natural world. An evidence 
base for these notions is growing in the US and UK, though researchers from other 
cultures openly <a class="link blue underline-hover" href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0013916520937457">question</a> apparent trends.</p>
  
  

<p>My <a class="link blue underline-hover" href="https://doi.org/10.1177/1609406917692647">mixed-paradigm</a> research project, conducted in the global south, provides the first account 
of nature connectedness in a large sample of Australian children and adolescents. 
Instead of privileging an adult-driven discourse that may inadvertently <a class="link blue underline-hover" href="https://doi.org/10.4324/9780429199721-11">marginalise</a> 
urban youth, it honours the voices of local children. Some of my findings, such as 
a <a class="link blue underline-hover" href="https://findingnature.org.uk/2019/06/12/teenage-dip/">teenage dip</a> in connections to nature, align with demographic patterns 
emerging overseas. By contrast, others&mdash;like the fact that half of the primary school students 
I surveyed had strong nature connections despite living in the city&mdash;trouble the 
deficit narrative and open up exciting new avenues for research.</p>

<p>For a more detailed summary of my findings, please take a look through my recent <a class="link blue underline-hover" href="#publications">publications</a>. I periodically tweet about my research, so <a class="link blue underline-hover" href="https://twitter.com/drryankeith">follow</a> me if you want some

<h2 class="mt6" id="teaching">Teaching</h2>
<p><img src="/assets/images/teaching.jpg" class="db ba w-100" /></p>

<p>Teaching is my vocation. I was invited to deliver my first guest lecture (on diversity 
in fishes) as a precocious second-year uni student. The audience? My peers in
Vertebrate Zoology! Surprisingly, it was received well, and I wasn't mercilessly 
teased for being the biggest teacher's pet to ever roam the campus. The experience lit a fire 
that led me to formally train as a high school teacher specialising in biology, 
chemistry, and earth & environmental sciences.</p>

<p>I started teaching zoology in a non-guest capacity during my undergraduate honours 
year and haven't stopped since. Most recently, I co-developed the online course 
'<a class="link blue underline-hover" href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/units/OLET1664">Science of Australia's Deadly Animals</a>' with Prof Dieter Hochuli. I built modules 
about snakes, spiders, sharks, and a veritable "fisherman's basket" of marine species. 
(Don't worry &mdash; we also explain these "usual suspects" <i>aren't</i> the deadliest 
Aussie fauna.)</p>

<p>My teaching style involves exploring the natural world alongside my students with 
curiosity and wonder, nurturing a love of nature and fervour for conservation. I 
am told it's effective; a former student shared the following impression in a centrally-
administered course evaluation:</p>

<i>
  <blockquote>
<p>"Ryan was amazing and his interest in the subject helped students keep their 
interest in the subject as well. You can tell he is passionate and very informed 
  about the information we cover."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My teaching has always extended beyond the hallowed <a class="link blue underline-hover" href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/tourists-sydney-university-hogwarts">Hogwarts-esque</a> halls of USyd. 
During my masters&mdash;and most of my PhD&mdash;years, I engaged zoo visitors from around 
the world in public talks about Australia's unique fauna. Nowadays I help organise 
school incursions focused on similar topics through my ongoing role as a Committee 
member of the <a class="link blue underline-hover" href="https://www.facebook.com/wildlifeconservationfund/">Wild Life Conservation Fund</a>.</p>

<p>Outside of conferences, you can also find me presenting my research to local 
community groups like <a class="link blue underline-hover" href="https://austplants.com.au/">Australian Plants Society</a> chapters. If you are seeking a speaker 
in my areas of expertise, please drop me an <a class="link blue underline-hover" href="mailto: drryankeith@gmail.com">email</a>.</p>
