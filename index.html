<h1>Ryan J. Keith</h1>

<p> I am an impactful educator and social-ecological scientist with eight years' experience teaching at universities, schools, and zoos. 
  I am particularly fascinated by interactions between people and natural environments, with my research currently focused on 
  understanding how urban children connect with nature.

  <h3>Genomics of the Darwin’s Finch radiation</h3>

  <p><img src="/assets/images/freq_cactus_diet_fig_V2.png" class="db ba w-100" /></p>

  <p>My postdoctoral research primarily focuses on the proximate mechanisms for how selection functions at the
    population
    and individual levels in the radiation of Thraupidae finches on the Galapágos Islands. The basis for this research
    has
    involved the generation and analysis of 4,000 Darwin’s finch genomes derived from individually marked finches
    collected over 40 years on Daphne Major by Drs. Peter and Rosemary Grant. This project required the development of
    methods to use low-coverage (2x) data to estimate population allele frequencies from wild populations. Using this
    dataset, we can identify and track through time functional variants related to natural variation.</p>

<p>I have led or contributed to the generation of novel resources for genomic studies on non-model species.
  These state of the art genome assemblies are chromosome scale and include high quality genome annotations.</p>
